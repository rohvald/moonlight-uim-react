# Moonlight UI React Component Library

## Usage

1. Import library stylesheet: `import '@rohvald/moonlight-uim-react/style.css'`
2. Tailwind classes are prefixed with `mnl-`
3. All images are inlined (sizes: 300-1200 bytes per image)

## Scripts

- `npm run storybook`
- `npm run build`

I don't use the rest of the scripts, `lint` is used in github workflow though.


## Attribution

This Vite React-TS-SB-TW Component Library is based on UI Mother's Moon Light Figma Kit.
